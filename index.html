<h2>Write-Up</h2>
<p><strong>Plot 1:</strong> This faceted bar chart visualizes the frequency of reported UFO shapes across the five U.S. states with the highest number of sightings. The primary objective of this chart is to compare shape patterns geographically across regions with the most activity. I used shape as the categorical variable encoded on the y-axis and the count of sightings (count) on the x-axis. To enhance comparison across states, I used column encoding to facet each state's results in a separate vertical chart, and applied color encoding by state for consistency across all facets. On the data side, I filtered out rows with missing state or shape values, and used value_counts() to identify the top five states by sighting volume. This chart was not reused from Homework #5; it is a new design developed specifically for this assignment and makes use of Altair's faceting and grouping capabilities. Since this plot is meant for comparison and not exploration, I did not include interactivity—its static nature makes it clean and easy to interpret.</p>
<p><strong>Plot 2:</strong>This visualization consists of two linked bar charts that allow the user to explore how UFO shape sightings vary by state. The first chart on the left displays the number of sightings per U.S. state, using state on the y-axis and count() on the x-axis. The second chart shows the distribution of UFO shapes within the selected state, using shape on the x-axis and count() on the y-axis. To make this plot interactive, I used alt.selection_point() with the state field, allowing users to click on a state in the first chart and filter the second chart accordingly. This interactivity was implemented via .transform_filter(state_click), and conditional coloring was applied to highlight the selected state (steelblue) while graying out the rest (lightgray). I also used color encoding for shape in the second chart to help differentiate categories visually. On the data side, I ensured missing state and shape values were dropped before plotting to maintain clarity. While I explored bar charts in Homework #5, this design goes beyond by adding meaningful interactivity and dynamic filtering via Vega-Lite. This interaction makes the visualization more engaging and insightful, enabling users to compare UFO shape distributions across different states with ease.</p>
<p><strong>Interactivity:</strong> For the second plot, I added interactivity using Altair’s selection_point, which allows users to click on a state and dynamically update the adjacent chart with data specific to that state. This feature makes the visualization more engaging and informative, as it enables the viewer to drill down into the shape distribution for any state of interest, offering a more personalized and focused analysis experience.</p>
